This project is using a subset of the LendingClub DataSet on Kaggle and the goal is to predict whether a potential customer will pay back their loan. 
To make this prediction, I have performed several data cleaning and transformation tasks such as reshaping columns and data types, removing unwanted features, performing imputations, string encoding and finally built a neural network based on ReLU and sigmoid activation functions. Visualised model predictions and evaluated model performance by looking at the precision, recall metrics and f1 score.
